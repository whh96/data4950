#### The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset and find a potential business application that could benefit a company or organization using the data. I chose a dataset that involved various self reported scores of mental wellbeing of medical school students.
---
#### The results bring to light the discrepency of mental health and burnout scores between males and females in the each half of medical school. The final models were trained to predict whether or not a student was male or female based off of the reported mental health scores with acceptable accuracy. The results were less focused on being able to predict sex given mental health scores and more focused on why I was able to predict sex given mental health scores with more than 50% accuracy.

#### My proposition was that an organization could use this tool to provide better mental health resources for students. It could determine what kind of resources they choose as well as how much they invest in these resources.
